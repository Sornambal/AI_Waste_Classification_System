# 🧠 Waste Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Deep Learning-based Waste Classifier** that helps identify the type of waste material from an image (e.g., glass, metal, plastic, paper). The aim is to contribute to **automated recycling systems** using **Computer Vision** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
